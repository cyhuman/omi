- **Charging LED**: On-board LED indicates charging status

### **Charging Process**
1. **Connect USB-C cable** to the ESP32-S3 board
2. **Red LED** = Charging in progress
3. **Green LED** = Fully charged
4. **Charging time**: ~2-3 hours for full charge

## üìä Monitoring Battery Status

### **Real-time Monitoring via Serial**

Connect to the device via serial monitor (921600 baud) and use these commands:

#### **Quick Status Check**
```
status
```
Shows current battery level, connection status, and device state.

#### **Charging Status Monitor**
```
charging
```
Takes 10 readings over 20 seconds and shows charging status:
- üîã **CHARGING** (>4.1V) - Actively charging
- ‚ö° **CHARGED** (3.9-4.1V) - Good charge level
- üî¥ **LOW** (3.7-3.9V) - Needs charging
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL** (<3.7V) - Check connections

#### **Continuous Monitor**
```
monitor
```
Continuous 5-second interval monitoring. Type any command to stop.

### **OMI App Battery Display**
The OMI app automatically shows battery percentage when connected to the glasses.

## üéØ Expected Voltage Levels

| **Voltage Range** | **Battery %** | **Status** | **Action** |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| **4.2V - 4.3V** | 100% | Fully charged | Ready to use |
| **4.0V - 4.2V** | 80-100% | Good charge | Normal operation |
| **3.8V - 4.0V** | 20-80% | Moderate | Continue use |
| **3.7V - 3.8V** | 0-20% | Low battery | Charge soon |
| **3.5V - 3.7V** | Critical | Very low | Charge immediately |
| **<3.5V** | Critical | Unsafe | Check hardware |

## üîå Charging Verification Steps

### **Step 1: Connect & Check Initial Reading**
```
status
```
Note the starting voltage (should be <4.1V if not charged).

### **Step 2: Connect Charger**
1. Plug in USB-C charger
2. Check for charging LED (red light)
3. Wait 5 minutes for voltage to stabilize

### **Step 3: Monitor Charging Progress**
```
charging
```
You should see:
- **Voltage increasing** over time
- **Status showing "CHARGING"** when >4.1V
- **Steady upward trend** in readings

### **Step 4: Verify Full Charge**
After 2-3 hours:
```
status
```
Should show:
- **Voltage: 4.2V-4.3V**
- **Battery: 100%**
- **Green charging LED**

## üîß Hardware Verification

### **Battery Connection Check**
The firmware monitors battery via:
- **Pin**: GPIO2 (A1) with voltage divider
- **Voltage divider**: 169kŒ©/110kŒ© resistors (1.862 ratio)
- **Expected ADC range**: 1.4V-2.3V (at GPIO2)

### **Connection Troubleshooting**

#### **Problem**: Always shows 0% or 100%
**Solution**: Check voltage divider connections
```
status
```
Look for unrealistic voltages (<2V or >5V)

#### **Problem**: Voltage doesn't change during charging
**Solution**: 
1. Verify charger is connected
2. Check charging LED on ESP32-S3
3. Try different USB cable/charger
4. Check battery connections

#### **Problem**: Shows "CRITICAL" with charger connected
**Solution**:
1. Check voltage divider wiring
2. Ensure A1 (GPIO2) is connected correctly
3. Verify resistor values (169kŒ© and 110kŒ©)

## ‚ö° Charging Best Practices

### **Optimal Charging**
- **Charge when battery drops below 20%** (3.8V)
- **Don't let battery go below 3.5V** (damages Li-ion cells)
- **Charge in moderate temperatures** (10¬∞C-40¬∞C)
- **Use quality USB-C charger** (5V, 1A minimum)

### **Battery Life Optimization**
- **Avoid complete discharge** (stop using at 3.7V)
- **Charge regularly** (don't leave dead for days)
- **Store at 50% charge** if not using for weeks
- **Expected battery life**: 10-12 hours continuous use

### **Status Monitoring Schedule**
- **Before use**: Quick `status` check
- **During long sessions**: Periodic `status` checks
- **While charging**: Use `charging` command to verify progress
- **For troubleshooting**: Use `monitor` for continuous tracking

## üÜò Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| **Issue** | **Command** | **Expected Result** | **Fix** |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Won't charge | `charging` | Voltage increases | Check charger/cable |
| Shows 0% always | `status` | Voltage <2V | Check hardware connections |
| Won't turn on | `monitor` | No response | Charge for 30+ minutes |
| Inconsistent readings | `charging` | Fluctuating values | Check loose connections |
| App shows wrong % | `status` | Compare readings | Reconnect BLE |

**For hardware issues**: Check the voltage divider circuit and ensure GPIO2 (A1) is properly connected to the battery voltage divider midpoint.
